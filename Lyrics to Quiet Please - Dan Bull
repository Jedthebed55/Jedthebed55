shhhhh, quiet please this is a library,
and i'd like some peace to read mindfully,
so mind your P's and Q's, else you might reieve abuse

when you let the wildest creature loose
see the blind leading you,leave you slightly confused
eardrums sliced, cleaved into
because my speak is blew, que to highly frequent use
it's a nice evening too, feel your life leaving you
you can try screaming futilely, i'd deem it foolhardy
I'll be here driving you doolally, RIP

cursed and blessed with sensitive hearing
you can never guess what it ends up revealing
goodness yes ever so queer things
shudders and tremors and intamate dealings
underhand sinister secretive feelings
hidden amid all the weeping and wailing
ears are pieced merely from squealing
shrieking, screaming, bringing in ceilings
shh, quiet please

hush, hush, hush, hush, hush
shush your mouth don't make a sound
whoops, you already have and the wardens been awaken now 
tut, tut, tut, tut
you just dug your own grave and fell down into a world of pain 

all you can do is pray for hell
darkness, closing in on all sides
i'd guess, your in for a wild ride
chance is whether you live or die
you want to return and it's obvious why

silence, can't you read the sign? are you stupid?
only i can vibe with the music
i'm not abusive, i'm a recluse with hyperacusis
try to unwind and i find you obtrusive
so now you'll find out how tiny my fuse is
once you kids die then i'll find other uses for you
'cause it's kind of amusing

better stay quieter than ASMR
or you may find out why i'm a pain in the arse
i shout this straight from the heart
my ribcage is the stage that emits soundwaves in the dark
like a flame from it's spark
creating a riot so loud it'll break you apart

try not to raise the alarm if your aim's to evade any harm
stay bloody calm
maybe you can, maybe you can't
maybe you'll try running staight to your mom
go crazily hard when i blaze with the bars

ay, kill a blaze get a bar they
say by this stage i'm basically Blas√©
baby but i say your late to the party
oh, hey, there you are mate
let's get straight to the part where i make you expire

in the Deep Dark, it's like a meat market
believe me, it's not for the weak hearted
you might be someones dearly departed
when i leave your entire life restarted
darkness, closing in on all sides
i'd guess, your in for a wild ride

hush, hush, hush, hush, hush
shush your mouth don't make a sound
whoops, you already have and the wardens been awaken now 
tut, tut, tut, tut
you just dug your own grave and fell down into a world of pain 

all you can do is pray for hell
darkness, closing in on all sides
i'd guess, your in for a wild ride
chance is whether you live or die
you want to return and it's obvious why

you have the right to remain silent
i have the right to remain violent
you have the right to remain silent
i have the right to remain violent
