shhhhh, quiet please this is a library,
and i'd like some peace to read mindfully,
so mind your P's and Q's, else you might reieve abuse

when you let the wildest creature loose
see the blind leading you,leave you slightly confused
eardrums sliced, cleaved into
because my speak is blew, que to highly frequent use
it's a nice evening too, feel your life leaving you
you can try screaming futilely, i'd deem it foolhardy
I'll be here driving you doolally, RIP

cursed and blessed with sensitive hearing
you can never guess what it ends up revealing
goodness yes ever so queer things
shudders and tremors and intamate dealings
underhand sinister secretive feelings
hidden amid all the weeping and wailing
ears are pieced merely from squealing
shrieking, screaming, bringing in ceilings
shh, quiet please
